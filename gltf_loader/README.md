This crate is intended to load [glTF 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/gltf), a file format designed for efficient transmission of 3D assets.

It's based on the [gltf](https://github.com/gltf-rs/gltf) crate but has an easy to use output.

This crate is perfect for your rendering projects (raytracer, OpenGL, rasterizer...).
